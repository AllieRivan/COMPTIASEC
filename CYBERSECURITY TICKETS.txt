TIER 2 HANDLING: 

SCENARIO 1: 

ACCOUNT TO BE USED: (USER 2)

Compromised Internal Server via Exploited Vulnerability
Ticket Title: Unauthorized Access to Internal Web Server

BODY: The SIEM system detected anomalous outbound traffic from an internal web server (web-srv-05), i
ncluding repeated connections to a suspicious external IP address. 
Preliminary analysis by Tier 1 revealed the server was 
hosting unexpected cryptocurrency-mining software and had 
unauthorized SSH login attempts from an unknown IP.


SOLUTION/MITIGATION 

Forensic Analysis:

Reviewed server logs and identified a successful exploit of CVE-2023-12345 (a known vulnerability in the server’s Apache Struts version).

Discovered a backdoor shell script (/tmp/.malicious_script) allowing persistent remote access.

Identified lateral movement attempts to other servers in the same subnet.


Impact Assessment:

The server was part of a critical customer-facing application, risking data exfiltration and service disruption.

Cryptocurrency-mining malware degraded server performance.

Potential exposure of internal network credentials stored in temporary files.

Mitigation Steps

Containment:

Isolated the compromised server from the network to prevent lateral movement.

Blocked the malicious external IP at the firewall.

Disabled non-essential services on the server.

Eradication:

Patched the Apache Struts vulnerability (CVE-2023-12345).

Removed the backdoor script and terminated malicious processes.

Replaced SSH keys and rotated all credentials associated with the server.

Recovery:

Restored the server from a clean backup after ensuring no residual malware.

Validated application functionality post-recovery.

Prevention:

Enforced automated vulnerability scanning and patch management for all servers.

Implemented a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block exploit attempts.

Restricted inbound/outbound traffic to the server using strict firewall rules.

Follow-Up Actions:

Conducted a full network sweep to identify other vulnerable servers.

Monitored the server for 72 hours post-recovery for anomalies.

Updated incident response playbooks to include Apache Struts vulnerability checks.


SCENARIO 2: 
ACCOUNT TO BE USED: USER 3 

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Lateral Movement
Ticket Title: Suspected APT Activity in Finance Department

BODY: An EDR alert flagged suspicious activity on a finance department workstation, including use of Mimikatz 
(a credential-dumping tool) and connections to internal 
servers hosting sensitive financial data. 
Tier 1 isolated the workstation but found evidence of 
attacker lateral movement to three additional systems.


SOLUTION/MITIGATION: 

Forensic Analysis:

Identified a phishing email (disguised as an invoice) sent to a finance employee as the initial attack vector.

Discovered the attacker used stolen credentials to pivot to the Domain Controller and extract Active Directory data.

Found evidence of data exfiltration to a foreign IP using encrypted HTTPS tunnels.

Impact Assessment:

Sensitive financial records (payroll, tax data) were accessed and exfiltrated.

Domain administrative privileges were temporarily compromised.

Risk of ransomware deployment or further data theft.

Mitigation Steps

Containment:

Isolated all compromised workstations and servers.

Reset passwords for all domain admin accounts and enforced MFA.

Blocked exfiltration IPs and domains at the firewall.

Eradication:

Removed malicious tools (e.g., Mimikatz) and persistence mechanisms.

Rebuilt compromised systems from clean images.

Revoked Kerberos tickets and invalidated all active sessions.

Recovery:

Restored financial data from offline backups.

Conducted a full AD audit to identify unauthorized changes.

Prevention:

Deployed endpoint detection rules to flag credential-dumping tools.

Enforced network segmentation to restrict access to financial systems.

Implemented email sandboxing to analyze attachments for malware.

Follow-Up Actions:

Engaged a third-party threat intelligence firm to track the APT group.

TIER 3 HANDLING 

SCENARIO 1: 

ACCOUNTS TO BE USED: (USER 3) 
Enterprise-Wide Ransomware Attack
Ticket Title: Ransomware Encryption of Critical Systems

BODY: A coordinated ransomware attack encrypted files across 200+ systems, including critical databases, finance servers, and backup repositories. Attackers deployed LockBit 4.0 ransomware via a compromised third-party vendor account, bypassing MFA through session hijacking. A ransom note demanded 
$5M in cryptocurrency for decryption keys.




SOLUTION/MITIGATION 

Forensic Investigation:

Attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the company’s VPN gateway (CVE-2023-98765) to gain initial access.

Lateral movement used PsExec and WMI to propagate ransomware.

Identified double extortion: Data was exfiltrated to a dark web leak site before encryption.


Impact Assessment:

Critical systems offline: Production, payroll, and customer databases encrypted.

Financial loss: Estimated $2M/hour downtime cost.

Reputational risk: Customer data leaked on dark web forums.

Mitigation Steps

Containment:

Shut down VPN access and isolated the entire network into segments to halt ransomware spread.

Disabled all non-essential services and protocols (e.g., SMB, RDP).

Engaged law enforcement (FBI Cyber Division) and ransomware negotiation experts.


Eradication:

Removed ransomware binaries and persistence mechanisms (e.g., scheduled tasks, registry entries).

Patched the VPN gateway vulnerability and revoked all active sessions.

Terminated attacker access by resetting all service accounts and domain admin credentials.


Recovery:

Restored systems from immutable, offline backups (unaffected by ransomware).

Deployed decryption tools provided by law enforcement (where applicable).


Prevention:

Implemented Zero Trust Architecture with micro-segmentation.

Migrated backups to air-gapped, write-once-read-many (WORM) storage.

Enforced phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2 keys) for all third-party vendors.

Follow-Up:

Conducted a 30-day network-wide hunt for dormant ransomware payloads.

Published a post-incident report to stakeholders and regulators.

Partnered with a threat intelligence firm to monitor dark web data leaks.


SCENARIO 2: 
ACCOUNTS TO BE USED: (USER 1) 

Nation-State APT Targeting Intellectual Property
Ticket Title: APT29 (Cozy Bear) Data Exfiltration Campaign

BODY: A threat intelligence firm alerted the organization to APT29 activity targeting R&D servers hosting proprietary technology blueprints. Attackers used polymorphic malware and living-off-the-land binaries (e.g., PowerShell, CertUtil) to evade detection. Data was exfiltrated via DNS tunneling over 6 months.

Forensic Investigation:

Initial access via a spear-phishing email with a malicious Excel macro (CVE-2023-54321).

Attackers deployed Cobalt Strike beacons for command-and-control (C2).

Exfiltrated 500GB of intellectual property (IP) to rogue DNS servers.

Impact Assessment:

Loss of competitive advantage due to stolen IP.

Risk of regulatory fines for failure to protect sensitive data.

Long-term reputational damage with clients and investors.

Mitigation Steps
Containment:

Blocked all C2 IPs and domains at the firewall and DNS layer.

Isolated R&D servers and revoked all user access.

Disabled macros and PowerShell across the enterprise.

Eradication:

Removed Cobalt Strike beacons and malicious scheduled tasks.

Rebuilt compromised servers with hardened configurations.

Rotated TLS certificates and Kerberos KRBTGT keys twice.

Recovery:

Restored pre-attack data snapshots for R&D servers.

Conducted a 90-day audit of all data access logs to identify exfiltrated files.

Prevention:

Deployed network traffic analysis (NTA) tools to detect DNS tunneling.

Implemented application allowlisting to block unauthorized binaries.

Enrolled in a managed threat detection and response (MDR) service.

Follow-Up:

Shared Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) with ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers).

Collaborated with federal agencies (CISA, DHS) for attribution and counterintelligence.

Launched a red team exercise to test defenses against APT tactics.
